# A simple cpu rasterizer

## Features
- Depth buffer
- Perspective correct texturing
- 4bit sub-pixel precision
- Guard-band clipping

## To-do
- Generic optimizations
- Threading support
- SIMD optimizations

## Maybe later
- Proper z-clipping
- 8bit sub-pixel precision
- Stencil buffer
- Restore support for vertex colors
